# Distributed AI on AWS: Reference Architectures & Examples <!-- omit from toc -->

This repository contains reference architectures and examples for distributed AI training and inference on [Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod.html), [AWS ParallelCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html), [AWS Parallel Computing Service (AWS PCS)](https://aws.amazon.com/pcs/), and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html). The examples cover different model families and sizes, training frameworks and parallel optimizations (PyTorch DDP/FSDP, Megatron-LM, NeMo), and serving engines (vLLM, SGLang, NVIDIA Dynamo).

The major components of this repository are:

## Workshops

You can follow the workshops below to train models on AWS. Each walks through several examples and shares practical guidance on operating a cluster for LLM training.

## Blog

Posts about distributed AI on AWS are published at <https://awslabs.github.io/awsome-distributed-ai/>. The Hugo source lives on the [`content`](https://github.com/awslabs/awsome-distributed-ai/tree/content) branch.

Blog content is editorially curated by AWS authors. Code samples in this repo (`architectures/`, `examples/`, etc.) accept external contributions as usual; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Architectures

Each subdirectory under `architectures/` is a deployable cluster architecture or a shared building block.

## Custom Amazon Machine Images

Custom machine images can be built using [Packer](https://www.packer.io) for AWS ParallelCluster, Amazon EKS, and plain EC2. These images are based on Ansible roles and playbooks.

## Examples

Examples live under `examples/` and are organized along two axes:

- **`examples/training/`** and **`examples/inference/`** are *framework-centric*: the training or inference engine is the subject, and model variants underneath illustrate it (e.g. `training/fsdp/`, `training/megatron-lm/`, `training/nemo/`). Swapping the model gives "the same example with a different model."
- **`examples/use-cases/`** is *use-case-centric*: a specific model or task is the subject and the framework is incidental (e.g. `use-cases/detr-finetune/`, `use-cases/vjepa2/`). Swapping the framework would still leave a recognizable demo.

Each example follows this general structure:

```
examples/
├── training/                   # framework-centric training/fine-tuning engines
│   └── <framework>/            # e.g. fsdp, deepspeed, megatron-lm, nemo, trl
│       └── <model>/            # e.g. llama3 (may be omitted for single-model cases)
│           ├── Dockerfile      # Container / environment setup
│           ├── README.md
│           ├── slurm/          # Slurm-specific launch scripts
│           └── kubernetes/     # Kubernetes manifests
├── inference/                  # framework-centric inference engines (vllm, …)
└── use-cases/                  # use-case-centric end-to-end demos
    └── <name>/                 # e.g. detr-finetune, esm2-hyperpod
```

The top-level directory for each example contains a general introduction and environment setup (Dockerfiles, training scripts, configs), while subdirectories provide service-specific launch instructions.

Browse [`examples/`](./examples) to see the full list of frameworks, engines, and use cases.

## Validation and Observability

Environment and cluster health validation tools live under `validation/`; monitoring stacks, metrics exporters, and profiling guides live under `observability/`.
